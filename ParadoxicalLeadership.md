About **Polarities**:
- Consist of 2 different *interrelated* poles and are *persistent* over time (they do not get "solved")
- Drive our behaviours and we feel and metabolize them as internal tension
- A stable system is always made of both opposite poles


 |Either/Or Approach| Both and Approach | 
 |--|--|
|Involves separating the 2 poles and associating with only one of them| Is rising where boundaries are fading and speed of change is increasing|
|It is appealing because offers: certainty, pure logic, clear commons|Must appreciate contribute also from the pole that initially seems negative|
|Leads to dylemmas, polarization, destruction of value|There are 7 strategies to integrate opposite poles|

Poles possible combinations:
 |Situation| Context|# | Name|
 |--| -- | --|--|
 |Crisis| Unilateral|1 | Either-Or|
 |Control| Bilateral and Separated|2 | Exhaust Valve|
|Control| Bilateral and Separated|3 | Silos|
|Flexibility| Bilateral and Separated|4 | Situational|
|Pragmatism| Bilateral and Combined|5 | Balance|
|Creativity| Bilateral and Combined|6 | Combinations|
|Creativity| Bilateral and Combined|7 | Synthesis|
